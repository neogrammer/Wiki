This effect implements a Disney-style (Roughness/Metalness workflow) Physically-Based Renderer ([PBR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physically_based_rendering)) effect using Image-Based Lighting ([IBL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image-based_lighting)) in combination with up to three directional lights. This effect also supports GPU instancing.

# Header
```cpp
#include <Effects.h>
```

# Initialization
Construction requires a Direct3D 11 device.

```cpp
std::unique_ptr<PBREffect> effect;
effect = std::make_unique<PBREffect>(device);
```

For exception safety, it is recommended you make use of the C++ [RAII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization) pattern and use a ``std::unique_ptr`` or ``std::shared_ptr``

# Interfaces
PBREffect supports [[IEffect]], [[IEffectMatrices]], and [[IEffectLights]].

Fog settings are not supported by this effect.

# Input layout
This effect requires ``SV_Position``, ``NORMAL``, and ``TEXCOORD0``. It does not support per-vertex color.

If instancing is enabled, this effect also requires these vertex elements:

```
"InstMatrix",  0, DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT
"InstMatrix",  1, DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT
"InstMatrix",  2, DXGI_FORMAT_R32G32B32A32_FLOAT
```

# Properties

* **SetAlpha**: Sets the alpha (transparency) of the effect. Defaults to 1 (fully opaque). This value is also used for binning opaque vs. transparent geometry.

* **SetConstantAlbedo**, **SetConstantMetallic**, and **SetConstantRoughness**: Used to set the constant value when not using texturing for the albedo, roughness, and metalness information.

* **SetAlbedoTexture**: Sets the albedo texture. This uses the sampler in slot 0. Can be set to nullptr to remove a reference. Can optionally include an alpha channel as well.

* **SetNormalTexture**: Sets the normal texture. This uses the sampler in slot 0. Can be set to nullptr to remove a reference.

> See [[NormalMapEffect|NormalMapEffect#normal-maps]] for more details about the normal map texture.

* **SetRMATexture**: Sets the roughness/metalness/ambient-occlusion (RMA) texture. This uses the sampler in slot 0. Can be set to nullptr to remove a reference.

> The RMA texture uses the [glTF2](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF) standard order: The _metalness_ is in the B channel, _roughness_ in the G channel, and _ambient occlusion_ in the R channel. If there's no ambient occlusion, then the R channel should be set to all 1.

* **SetEmissiveTexture**: Associates an emissive texture with the effect. This uses the sampler in slot 0. Can be set to nullptr to remove a reference.

* **SetSurfaceTextures**: Associates a albedo texture, normal texture, and roughness/metalness/ambient-occlusion (RMA) texture with the effect in one method. This uses the sampler in slot 0. Can be set to nullptr to remove a reference.

* **SetIBLTextures**: Associates a radiance and irradiance texture with the effect. The number of miplevels in the radiance texture is also required as this is used to compute roughness. This uses the sampler in slot 1. Can be set to nullptr to remove a reference.

> The _radiance_ and _irradiance_ map are special cubemaps. They are generated by tools like [AMD Cubemapgen](https://seblagarde.wordpress.com/2012/06/10/amd-cubemapgen-for-physically-based-rendering/), [cmft](https://github.com/dariomanesku/cmft)/[cmftStudio](https://github.com/dariomanesku/cmftStudio), [IBLBaker](https://github.com/derkreature/IBLBaker), and [Lys](https://www.knaldtech.com/lys/).

* **SetBiasedVertexNormals**: Enables support for compressed vertex normals which require ``*2 - 1`` biasing at runtime such as ``DXGI_FORMAT_R10G10B10A2_UNORM``.

* **SetInstancingEnabled**: Enables support for per-vertex instancing by adding a per-vertex ``XMFLOAT3X4`` transform matrix.

* **SetVelocityGeneration**: Enables the generation of a velocity buffer. If set to true, then both a Render Target 0 and Render Target 1 must be bound for rendering.

> This effect does *not* support both instancing and velocity generation at the same time.

* **SetRenderTargetSizeInPixels**: Used to set the pixel size of the render target when generating velocity buffers.

# Remarks

This effect always performs per-pixel lighting. Calls to ``SetLightingEnabled(false);`` will generate a C++ exception, and calls to **SetPerPixelLighting** are ignored.

The lighting modeling for PBR does not make use of an ambient or specular term as these are more directly modeled by the image-based lighting model. Calls to **SetAmbientLightColor** and **SetLightSpecularColor** are ignored.

This effect requires a texture sampler in both slots 0 and 1. [[GeometricPrimitive]] and [[SpriteBatch]] only set a texture sampler in slot 0 by default, [[Model]] sets a sampler in slots 0 and 1.

# Feature Level Notes

This effect uses Shader Model 4.0 so requires Direct3D hardware feature level 10.0 or greater.

> Note this means you can also count on ``DXGI_FORMAT_BC5_UNORM`` texture compression hardware support for your normal maps.
