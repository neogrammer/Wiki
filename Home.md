# DirectX 11
DirectX 11 is supported on Windows  7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, and Windows 11. Use of DirectX 11 for beginners is highly recommended.

# DirectX 12
A version of _DirectX Tool Kit for DirectX 12_ is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTK12). DirectX 12 is an expert API for Windows 10 / Windows 11 which builds on knowing the ins & outs of DirectX 11. Both DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 provide access to the same graphics hardware features, but drive the hardware in different ways which can allow a well-optimized DirectX 12 engine to achieve much lower CPU overhead than in DirectX 11.

> Note that advanced hardware features like Shader Model 6, DirectX Raytracing, Amplification & Mesh Shaders, and other "DirectX Ultimate" features do in fact require DirectX 12 as they are not exposed in DirectX 11. The statement above is still 100% true for the core graphics functionality used by *DirectX Tool Kit*.

# NuGet

DirectX Tool Kit is also available from the NuGet Gallery:
- [Windows desktop app using VS 2019 or VS 2022](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_2019/)
- [Windows desktop app using VS 2019 or VS 2022 for Windows 10](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_desktop_win10/)
- [Universal Windows Platform apps using VS 2019 or VS 2022](https://www.nuget.org/packages/directxtk_uwp/)

# vcpkg C++ Package Manager
